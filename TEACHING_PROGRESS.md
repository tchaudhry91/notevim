# NoteVim Teaching Progress

## Teaching Methodology
- **Student-led learning**: Student writes ALL code themselves
- **Concept-first approach**: Teach concepts, then guide implementation
- **Use specialized agents**: Use Task tool with appropriate agents for teaching
- **No copy-paste**: Never provide full code solutions, only patterns and concepts
- **Check understanding**: Ask questions before moving to implementation
- **Test frequently**: Verify each step works before moving forward

## Step 1: COMPLETED ✅
**Date**: 2025-07-28
**Concepts Taught**:
- Neovim plugin architecture (plugin/ vs lua/)
- Two-phase loading system (startup vs on-demand)
- Command creation with `vim.api.nvim_create_user_command`
- Lua module system with require() and return
- Module connections between files

**Files Created by Student**:
- `plugin/notevim.lua` - Command registration (3 commands: Note, NoteSearch, NoteSync)
- `lua/notevim/init.lua` - Main module with placeholder functions + setup()
- `lua/notevim/search.lua` - Search module with conditional logic

**Testing Results**: All commands working perfectly:
- `:Note path` prints "Creating note...path"
- `:NoteSearch query` prints "searching for query"  
- `:NoteSearch` prints "Showing recent notes"
- `:NoteSync` prints "syncing"

**Student Understanding Level**: 
- Excellent grasp of plugin architecture
- Understands command creation and argument handling
- Comfortable with module system and require()
- Ready for Step 2 implementation

## Step 2: COMPLETED ✅
**Date**: 2025-07-29
**Concepts Taught**:
- File path handling with concatenation and `vim.fn.simplify()`
- Path expansion with `vim.fn.expand()`
- Directory extraction with `vim.fn.fnamemodify(path, ":h")`
- Directory creation with `vim.fn.mkdir(dir, "p")`
- File existence checking with `vim.fn.filereadable()`
- Buffer content manipulation with `vim.api.nvim_buf_set_lines()`
- Configuration system with `vim.tbl_deep_extend()`

**Implementation by Student**:
- Added configurable `notes_dir` with default `~/Notes`
- Implemented full `M.note(path)` function with:
  - S3-style path support
  - Automatic `.md` extension
  - Nested directory creation
  - "tags:" line for new notes only
  - Proper error handling logic

**Key Learning Moments**:
- Initially had logic backwards for file existence check
- Learned that `vim.cmd.edit()` creates files, affecting existence checks
- Discovered need to check existence BEFORE opening file
- Successfully debugged and fixed the logic independently

**Testing Results**: 
- New notes get "tags:" line correctly
- Existing notes open without modification
- Deeply nested paths work (tested 5 levels deep)
- Configuration system works with custom directories

## Next Session Instructions

**For Claude**: When student returns:

1. **Welcome back**: Recap Step 2 achievements (real note creation)
2. **Use software-architect-planner agent**: For Step 3 teaching (search functionality)
3. **Teaching approach**: 
   - Explain ripgrep integration concepts
   - Teach Telescope API basics
   - Guide through quickfix fallback implementation
   - Show how to get file modification times for "recent notes"
4. **Step 3 Goals**: Implement search in `lua/notevim/search.lua`

**Key Step 3 Concepts to Teach**:
- `vim.fn.system()` for running external commands (ripgrep)
- `vim.fn.glob()` for finding all note files
- `vim.fn.getftime()` for file modification times
- Telescope picker creation (if available)
- Quickfix list as fallback
- Parsing ripgrep output

**Student's Preferred Learning Style**:
- Wants to understand "why" behind each decision
- Prefers hands-on implementation over theory
- Likes step-by-step building with frequent testing
- Responds well to concept explanations followed by guided practice
- Good at debugging when given hints about the issue

## Current Plugin State
- Basic architecture complete and tested
- Note creation fully functional with configuration
- Ready for search implementation
- Student has strong foundation for advanced features

## Git Status
- All Step 2 work ready to commit
- Clean working directory
- Ready for Step 3 development
