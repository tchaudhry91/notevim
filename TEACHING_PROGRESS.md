# NoteVim Teaching Progress

## Teaching Methodology
- **Student-led learning**: Student writes ALL code themselves
- **Concept-first approach**: Teach concepts, then guide implementation
- **Use specialized agents**: Use Task tool with appropriate agents for teaching
- **No copy-paste**: Never provide full code solutions, only patterns and concepts
- **Check understanding**: Ask questions before moving to implementation
- **Test frequently**: Verify each step works before moving forward

## Step 1: COMPLETED âœ…
**Date**: 2025-07-28
**Concepts Taught**:
- Neovim plugin architecture (plugin/ vs lua/)
- Two-phase loading system (startup vs on-demand)
- Command creation with `vim.api.nvim_create_user_command`
- Lua module system with require() and return
- Module connections between files

**Files Created by Student**:
- `plugin/notevim.lua` - Command registration (3 commands: Note, NoteSearch, NoteSync)
- `lua/notevim/init.lua` - Main module with placeholder functions + setup()
- `lua/notevim/search.lua` - Search module with conditional logic

**Testing Results**: All commands working perfectly:
- `:Note path` prints "Creating note...path"
- `:NoteSearch query` prints "searching for query"  
- `:NoteSearch` prints "Showing recent notes"
- `:NoteSync` prints "syncing"

**Student Understanding Level**: 
- Excellent grasp of plugin architecture
- Understands command creation and argument handling
- Comfortable with module system and require()
- Ready for Step 2 implementation

## Next Session Instructions

**For Claude**: When student returns:

1. **Welcome back**: Briefly recap Step 1 achievements
2. **Use software-architect-planner agent**: For Step 2 teaching (note creation implementation)
3. **Teaching approach**: 
   - Explain file I/O concepts in Neovim/Lua
   - Teach buffer creation and manipulation
   - Guide through directory creation logic
   - Let student write all implementation code
4. **Step 2 Goals**: Implement actual note creation in `M.note(path)` function

**Key Step 2 Concepts to Teach**:
- `vim.fn.expand()` for path expansion
- `vim.fn.mkdir()` for directory creation  
- `vim.cmd.edit()` for opening files
- Buffer manipulation with `vim.api.nvim_buf_set_lines()`
- File path validation and error handling

**Student's Preferred Learning Style**:
- Wants to understand "why" behind each decision
- Prefers hands-on implementation over theory
- Likes step-by-step building with frequent testing
- Responds well to concept explanations followed by guided practice

## Current Plugin State
- Basic architecture complete and tested
- All command registrations working
- Ready for actual functionality implementation
- Student has strong foundation for next steps

## Git Status
- All Step 1 work committed to main branch
- Clean working directory
- Ready for Step 2 development
